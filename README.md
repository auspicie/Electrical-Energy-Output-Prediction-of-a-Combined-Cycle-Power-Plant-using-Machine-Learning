# Electrical-Energy-Output-Prediction-of-a-Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant-using-Machine-Learning
The use of ML to predict electrical energy output of a combined cycle powerplant
# About the project
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the Electrical Energy Output (PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant based on ambient conditions. We utilize the UCI CCPP dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant. The data was loaded, preprocessed, and various regression models were built, trained, optimsed with a comprehensive evaluation.
